# CSGO_Theme_Control
--------------------------
A Simple program to manage your current Windows theme when playing or not playing CSGO.

# Why
--------------------------
Simply put, Aero sucks. With the Aero theme enabled over a high contrast or classic theme, CSGO ran at nearly 200 fps on my system, almost 100 fps less than the usual along with an added feeling of sluggishness and input delay.

This program attempts to remedy this program by automatically changing your Windows theme to a low contrast theme(or a custom theme) whenever the game is active, it will also change it back to Aero after the csgo exe has exited.

The program also includes the ability to setup custom hotkeys to adjust theme at any time anywhere.

# Will This Get You Banned
--------------------------
<b>No</b>, it doesn't touch the CSGO process in any way. If you get a VAC ban while using this program then you cheated.

# General Usage
--------------------------
## Requirements
- [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40779 "Download Link")

## UI
With extreme simplicity as a design point I don't think there is much to be said here. The Status text box will change as you modify settings and options.
